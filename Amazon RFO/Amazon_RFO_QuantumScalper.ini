# This EA implements a quantum-style scalping system that:
# 1. Opens multiple micro-positions simultaneously
# 2. Uses rapid repeated analysis (quantum approach)
# 3. Adapts to different market regimes
# 4. Self-optimizes based on performance every 20 trades
# 5. Maintains persistent memory across restarts
# 6. Implements recovery strategies after losses
# 7. Uses dynamic TP/SL based on volatility
# 8. Trails stops dynamically
